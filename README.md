## Check Your Understanding Question
1. The automated tests should be put within a GitHub action that runs whenever code is pushed. This allows for a smooth integration process where feedbacks can be immediately provided to catch bug and reduce human errors.
   
2. No, you would not use an end-to-end test to check if a function is returning the correct output. Such job would be more appropriate for unit tests. E2E tests are meant to simulate realistic user interactions with the application as a whole.
   
3. Navigation mode provides an overall metric  on aspects such as load time, accessibility, and Progressive Web App capabilities for your website right after it loads, i.e. its "initial" state with no changes. Snapshot mode, on the other hand, analyzes your page in its current state with any given changes. This means your tests can include user interactions and check for UI hidden behind clicks and submissions.
   
4. Things we could do to improve the site:
   1. Add a meta description in order to summarize the site's content and optimize its searchability with search engines.
   2. Define a viewport tag so the site is more adaptable to various screen sizes of different devices.
   3. Resize the images to the appropraite rendered size to save data and improve on loading times.
